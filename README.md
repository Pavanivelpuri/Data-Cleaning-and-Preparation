# Project Title
Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Overview

This project focuses on the process of data cleaning and preparation to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and suitable for analysis. Data cleaning is a crucial step in data science as it involves addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the dataset.

In this project, we work with a dataset related to life expectancy and apply various techniques to clean and preprocess the data. This includes:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and filling or imputing missing data points to prevent bias in analysis.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying outliers that could skew the results and applying methods to handle them appropriately.
- **Normalization**: Scaling numerical values to a common range to ensure consistent data representation and improve the performance of machine learning models.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting data into formats that are more suitable for analysis, including feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.

The goal is to produce a clean and well-structured dataset ready for further analysis or modeling.

## Files Included

- `Life Expectancy Data.csv`: The original dataset containing life expectancy information with potential issues such as missing values and outliers.
- `Cleaned_Life_Expectancy_Data.csv`: The cleaned version of the dataset after applying data cleaning techniques, making it ready for analysis.
- `Data Cleaning and Preparation.ipynb`: A Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the data cleaning and preparation process, including code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Google Colab Notebook
